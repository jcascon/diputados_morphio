# # Write out to the sqlite database using scraperwiki library
#ScraperWiki.save_sqlite(["name"], {"name" => "juan", "occupation" => "CDO ABC.es"})

# # An arbitrary query against the database

# You don't have to do things with the Mechanize or ScraperWiki libraries. You can use whatever gems are installed
# on Morph for Ruby (https://github.com/openaustralia/morph-docker-ruby/blob/master/Gemfile) and all that matters
# is that your final data is written to an Sqlite database called data.sqlite in the current working directory which
# has at least a table called data.
#puts 'hola mundo'
